I'm a final-year BSc IT student with a strong interest in software development, tech support, and web technologies. I enjoy building practical tools and improving digital systems through clean, functional code.

I'm continuously learning and currently exploring cloud technologies, AI tools, and full-stack development. Always open to collaboration, feedback, and new opportunities to grow as a developer.

🔧 Skills:  
C#, C++, Java, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, ASP.NET, PHP, VB.NET  

📚 Interests:  
Web development, software support, cloud tools, real-world problem solving  

🌟 Fun fact:  
Outside of coding, I enjoy creating content and visual designs — from logos and posters to digital layouts.
